### Payment Integration
- **Paddle Billing** (for $5/month subscriptions)
  - Server-side: `@paddle/paddle-node-sdk` for transaction creation
  - API endpoint: `/api/create-checkout-session` creates Paddle transactions and returns checkout URLs
  - Environment: Auto-detects sandbox vs production based on API key prefix (pdl_sdbx_ = sandbox, pdl_live_ = production)
  - Current Status: **Configured in Sandbox mode** - fully functional for testing
    - Sandbox API Key: pdl_sdbx_... (configured in secrets)
    - Sandbox Price ID: pri_01k7q8k5740qednqg9wepm2g5v
    - Default Payment Link: Configured in Paddle dashboard
  - Production Migration: When Paddle onboarding completes, update secrets with production credentials:
    - Replace PADDLE_API_KEY with live key (pdl_live_...)
    - Replace PADDLE_PRICE_ID with production price ID
    - System will auto-detect and switch to production mode
  - Flow: User clicks subscribe → Backend creates transaction → Redirect to Paddle hosted checkout
  - Advantages: Multi-currency support (30+ currencies), automatic tax/VAT compliance, acts as Merchant of Record
